In this data project I will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. Fist I will directly read the stock data from YAHOO for the banks I selected use pandas datareader.
Then I will dig into the dataset see what I can found the relationship among all the banks I selected. I will also perform some calcualtions within the dataframe to analyze the areas I woud like to discover. 
To perform the exploratory data analysis, I will use seaborn to plot data set variable to identify the relationships among them.
